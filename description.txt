This mod adds a whole bunch of keybinds ranging from simple toggles and dashing to Recall Potion usage and better inventory navigation. Next to keybinds some tweaks, such as scrolling the inventory while using an item, are also added. Configs are offered where relevant.
If you have any suggestions, put them into the comment section.

List of keybinds:
[list]
    [*] Chest actions
    [*] Dashing (compatible with Vanilla, Calamity, Fargo's Souls, ...?)
    [*] Dynamic shortcuts to inventory slots ("Dynamic Hotbar" from console Terraria)
    [*] Equipment Change
    [*] Toggling rulers
    [*] Using the Rod of Discord/Harmony
    [*] Using teleport items like Recall Potions and the Magic Conch (including teleport items from the Thorium Mod)
    [*] Using the Money Trough and Void Bag
    [*] Using bug nets
[/list]

List of tweaks (all can be disabled separately in the configs):
[list]
    [*] Allow the mousewheel to scroll through the entire inventory
    [*] Allow the mousewheel to scroll through the inventory during item usage
    [*] Disable wall climb from climbing gear
    [*] Select a hammer with auto select while holding Alt
    [*] Select a regrowth item when hovering an alchemy plant (this works with modded plants if they are registered in Main.tileAlch)
    [*] Select alchemy plants seeds when hovering over a planter box (only works with vanilla planters and seeds)
    [*] Cancel channeling items (e.g. Yoyos or Flails) without manually releasing Use Item by switching items
[/list]

Instruction for Dynamic Hotbar:
[olist]
    [*] Open your inventory
    [*] Hover over a slot and press the keybind to bind it to that inventory slot
    [*] Press it again to switch to that slot
    [*] Hold the button for a moment while in your inventory to unbind it
[/olist]
Note: Starting from a slot that is not referenced by Dynamic Hotbar will store that slot into its memory. Pressing the same Dynamic Hotbar key again will change the current slot to the slot in memory. Using hotbar keys or scrolling through the inventory will clear the memory while using another Dynamic Hotbar key will not.

Instruction for Equipment Change:
[olist]
    [*] Open your inventory
    [*] Hover over a slot and press the keybind to define the slot as the source slot
        [list]
            [*] All main inventory slots (including coins and ammo) can be set as source
        [/list]
    [*] Hover over a second slot and press the keybind again to define that slot as the target slot
        [list]
            [*] Instead pressing the keybind again on the same slot will match the target based on the item in that slot (works for miscellaneous equipment and armor)
            [*] Allows all slots except for vanity and dye
        [/list]
    [*] Press the button again to activate it
        [list]
            [*] When a mount is active and another one is switched in the new mount will be mounted (configurable)
        [/list]
    [*] Hold the button for a moment while in your inventory to unbind it
[/olist]
Extra note: Changing mounts or minecarts while mounted also changes the active mount
